                <p class="margin-bottom">Skilled workers at TK’s use centuries old art of handcrafting Salt Lamps and Candleholders (T-Light Holders) in different shapes and designs. Most of the designs are conceived by the production team however, on demand, decorative salt products can be produced according to given designs and specs. Salt Lamps and T-Light Holders are not just abstract salt stones; instead each piece is crafted with hands which give it a unique and attractive shape. </p>
              
                <p class="margin-bottom">Food Salt produced at TK’s gets tested on regular basis from recognized laboratories against specified standards. Each lot of food salt must pass lab test from NPSL or PCSIR Labs before export.

From purchase of raw material to packing the finished products, whole process undergoes a number of quality checks at each stage. That’s why not only volume of exports has grown but TK’s has earned the trust among its international customers.
